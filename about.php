<p>We’re Language in Place.  Our mission is to make the world a smaller, better place through the power of shared language.</p>
<br>
<p>Language in Place grew out of our excitement at the possibility for technology to improve the process of learning and maintaining non-native language skills.  In an increasingly global world – a world of global schools and global travelers and global businesses – we want to make it easier for you to communicate in global languages.</p>
<br>
<p>When we were growing up, learning to read foreign languages was a grind.  We remember slogging through tired textbook passages, enduring the endless routine of picking up and putting down ironclad translation dictionaries.  This made our arms tired.  Even worse, it made our brain tired.  We longed for content that we found interesting and fresh – like current news and the kind of books we were already reading in English.  We loved foreign language and culture and knew there was a better way, for students and for teachers.</p>
<br>
<p>At Learning in Place, we believe becoming immersed in foreign language is one of life’s most rewarding experiences.  So we decided to make it possible to read and translate any text you want - and to make it simple, fun and easy.</p>
