* no hover UI -- needs to work well on an iPad

* translate each word
* translate whole sentence
* subtle google ads / amazon affiliate links
* vocab box with words you've had to click on -- should this follow you down the page, or should words annotate the side of the page?

"make my own textbook"
1.  upload text you want
2.  click on words that you want used for scaffolding 
    * could maybe build a smarty-type tool so teachers can quickly find dictionary definitions of words (with parts of speech and gender, etc)
3.  decide whether other words should be clickable
4.  download list of vocab words so you can assign quizzes etc
5.  allow the teacher to read each sentence out loud so the kid can listen while they learn (extra money cause of hosting costs)

-- could make a way to make the textbooks distributable in the iBooks textbook store thing
